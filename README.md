# databases_project
Here we are creating a website for our databases project at the GUC.
We will be using python Django framework for creating this website.
And we will use MySQL as our database.

In the settings.py file specify your DB info username, pass, etc
I needed to install this package: python-mysqldb

# IMPORTANT NOTICE
Make sure you copy settings_default.py into a new file named settings.py in the same directory.
 Then change the attributes inside the settings.py file to match your computer's.
